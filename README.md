## What is Odin-Recipes?
Odin-Recipes is one of the individual assignments of the Odin Project's Foundations Course curriculum. It consists of a simple website that contains links to a few recipes. For now, it's just basic HTML (and brutalist web design). It will be styled with CSS in the future.

## Skills practiced
- HTML elements like <p>, <a>, <ul>, <ol>, and <li>.
- Use of the command line for creating, deleting, and moving files and directories.
- Practice of atomic commits with Git.
- Creation and management of Github repositories.
